## 📂 Dataset

This project uses a synthetic e-commerce dataset created for learning and demonstration purposes.

### Files
- orders.csv – transactional order data
- customers.json – customer master data
- products.csv – product catalog

The dataset is intentionally small and can be scaled easily for production use cases.
